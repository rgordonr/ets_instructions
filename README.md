# Study Instructions

This is an overview of the study you are currently enrolled in and the software you will use to complete this study.

# Study Procedures

In this study you will report your emotional experiences throughout each day of the study. The app you installed on your phone should prompt you to report these experiences up to six times a day between 9am and 9pm. We understand that you will be unable to response to all of these prompts, but we hope you will be able to respond to most of them. You can also report your emotions without being prompted by a notification.

Beyond knowing how you feel, we also want to know information about the context surrounding your emotions, like where you were, who you were with, and what you were doing. However, dropping what you're doing to answer these questions in addition to reporting emotions would be overly burdensome. To keep things convenient for you, you can supply this extra data on the main website (accessible by tapping REPORT DATA at the bottom of the app's screen) at a more conveinent time. I will explain more about this process in the next section.

Lastly, we want to know broadly about the events that transpire throughout your day-to-day life. We collect these data from you using a time diary (also found on the main website). Each day of this study will have its own diary. To complete a diary for a certain day, you will first start by reporting what you were doing at midnight of this day, how long this activity lasted, and other details. You will continue reporting activities until you've reported on at least 24 hours.

Overall, throughout the course of this study, you need to respond to the prompts to report emotions and periodically (ideally, each day) visit the main website to see what data are needed from you.

In what follows, I will cover the process you will go through to:

* report emotions
* provide context for these emotions
* complete your daily time diary

# Reporting your emotions

Assuming you've already logged in to the app, the app will look like something like this when you first open it:
