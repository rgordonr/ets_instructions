# Study Instructions

This is an overview of the study you are currently enrolled in and the software you will use to complete this study.

# Study Procedures

In this study you will report your emotional experiences throughout each day of the study. The app you installed on your phone should prompt you to report these experiences up to six times a day between 9am and 9pm. We understand that you will be unable to response to all of these prompts, but we hope you will be able to respond to most of them. You can also report your emotions without being prompted by a notification.

Beyond knowing how you feel, we also want to know information about the context surrounding your emotions, like where you were, who you were with, and what you were doing. However, dropping what you're doing to answer these questions in addition to reporting emotions would be overly burdensome. To keep things convenient for you, you can supply this extra data on the main website (accessible by tapping REPORT DATA at the bottom of the app's screen) at a more conveinent time. I will explain more about this process in the next section.

Lastly, we want to know broadly about the events that transpire throughout your day-to-day life. We collect these data from you using a time diary (also found on the main website). Each day of this study will have its own diary. To complete a diary for a certain day, you will first start by reporting what you were doing at midnight of this day, how long this activity lasted, and other details. You will continue reporting activities until you've reported on at least 24 hours.

**Overall, throughout the course of this study, you have two central responsibilities**. You need to **(1) respond to the prompts to report emotions** and **(2) periodically (ideally, each day) visit the main website** to see what data are needed from you.

In what follows, I will cover the process you will go through to:

* report emotions
* provide context for these emotions
* complete your daily time diary

# Reporting your Emotions

Assuming you've already logged in to the app, the app will look like something like this when you first open it:

You scroll through the list of emotions to find those that adequately capture how you're feeling. After you make a selection, you will be asked to report the intensity of your emotion from 1 to 7.

Once you've made a decision, you can tap the ADD EMOTION button to append this emotion to your submission. If you had reported being moderately excited, your screen will now look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/4.png" width="400">

Once you've selected at least one emotion, a button will apear at the bottom of the screen labeled SUBMIT EMOTIONS. If you tap this button, the screen will reset and the counter in the top left will increment by 1. This is all you need to do to respond when the app prompts you to know how you're feeling. 

Your screen should now look like this:

You are now free to exit the app and go about your day.

# Reporting Context for your Emotions

When you report how you're feeling, we create what we call an "emotion event". You provide context for this event on our main website. You can access this website via the in-app browser (by tapping REPORT DATA) or via a normal browser using the url we gave you when you signed up for the study. (You are welcome to email us if you have forgotten this url).

The first time you attempt to visit the main website, you'll need to log in using the same credentials you used to log into the app. Once you've logged, your screen will look like this:

All data you submit in this study is categorized by date, and the three cells on the main website (Today, Yesterday, and Follow-up Data) correspond to the time periods you may be asked to report data about. You can tap each cell to learn more about the data we need from you. For example, if you tap Today, your screen would now look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/7.png" width="400">

I will explain the time diary in a later section. For right now, notice that "2 event(s) need your attention". We categorize your emotion events by their submission date. The main website it telling us that I reported how I was feeling two times today but haven't provided further contextual information about my emotions. If I tap Update Your Events, the screen would look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/8.png" width="400">

I reported feeling excited earlier in this tutorial, which is why it is now showing up here. However, several hours earlier I reported feeling at ease, excited, and proud. I can tap on either of these events to provide further context. If I tap on the earlier event, the screen would now look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/9.png" width="400">

We are now about to provide further context for one of our events. The first thing the website wants to know if the activity we were engaging in when we reported our emotions. There are several preset options available to you. They appear in the window below the text entry as you begin to type out what you were doing. For example, if I typed Work, I'd see this:
