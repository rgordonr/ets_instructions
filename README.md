# Study Instructions

This is an overview of the study you are currently enrolled in and the software you will use to complete this study.

# Study Procedures

In this study you will report your emotional experiences throughout each day of the study. The app you installed on your phone should prompt you to report these experiences up to six times a day between 9am and 9pm. We understand that you may be unable to response to all of these prompts, but we hope you will be able to respond to most of them. You can also report your emotions without being prompted by a notification.

Beyond knowing how you feel, we also want to know information about the context surrounding your emotions, like where you were, who you were with, and what you were doing. However, dropping what you're doing to answer these questions in addition to reporting emotions would be overly burdensome. To keep things convenient for you, you can supply this extra data on the main website (accessible by tapping REPORT DATA at the bottom of the app's screen) at a more conveinent time. I will explain more about this process in the next section.

Lastly, we want to know broadly about the events that transpire throughout your day-to-day life. We collect these data from you using a time diary (also found on the main website). Each day of this study will have its own diary. To complete a diary for a certain day, you will first start by reporting what you were doing at midnight of this day, how long this activity lasted, and other details. You will continue reporting activities until you've reported on at least 24 hours.

In this study, you have two central responsibilities. You need to **(1) respond to the notification asking how you are feeling** and **(2) periodically (ideally, each day) visit the main website** to provide additional data about your emotional experiences and daily activities.

In what follows, I will cover the process you will go through to:

* report emotions
* provide context for these emotions
* respond to follow-up questions about your emotions
* complete your daily time diary

# Reporting your Emotions

Assuming you've already logged in to the app, the app will look something like this when you first open it:
<p>

<p>
You scroll through the list of emotions to find those that adequately capture how you're feeling. After you make a selection, you will be asked to report the intensity of your emotion from 1 to 7.

Once you've made a decision, you can tap the ADD EMOTION button to append this emotion to your submission. If you reported being moderately excited, your screen would now look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/4.png" width="400">

Once you've selected at least one emotion, a button will apear at the bottom of the screen labeled SUBMIT EMOTIONS. If you tap this button, the screen will reset and the counter in the top left will increment by 1. This is all you need to do to respond when the app prompts you to know how you're feeling. 

You are now free to exit the app and go about your day.

# Reporting Context for your Emotions

When you report how you're feeling, we create what we call an "emotion event". You provide context for this event on our main website. You can access this website via the in-app browser (by tapping REPORT DATA) or via a normal browser using the url we gave you when you signed up for the study. (You are welcome to email us if you have forgotten this url).

The first time you attempt to visit the main website, you'll need to log in using the same credentials you used to log into the app. Once you've logged, your screen will look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/6.png" width="400">

All data you submit in this study is categorized by date, and the three cells on the main website (Today, Yesterday, and Follow-up Data) correspond to the time periods you may be asked to report data about. You can tap each cell to learn more about the data we need from you. For example, if you tap Today, your screen would now look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/7.png" width="400">

I will explain the time diary in a later section. For right now, notice that "2 event(s) need your attention". We categorize your emotion events by their submission date. The main website it telling us that I reported how I was feeling two times today but haven't provided further contextual information about my emotions. If I tap Update Your Events, the screen would look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/8.png" width="400">

I reported feeling excited earlier in this tutorial, which is why it is now showing up here. However, several hours earlier I reported feeling at ease, excited, and proud. I can tap on either of these events to provide further context. If I tap on the earlier event, the screen would look like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/9.png" width="400">

We are now about to provide further context for one of our events. The first thing the website wants to know is the activity you were engaged in when you reported our emotions. There are several preset options available to you. They appear in the window below the text entry as you begin to type out what you were doing. For example, if I typed "Work", I'd see this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/10.png" width="400">

Please try to find the category that best fits your activity. If no category exists, feel free to type out your own activity.

After you are done describing what you were doing, you then tell us about who was also present and where the activity occured. Once you submit your response, you'll be taken back to the previous page. For me, it now looks like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/11.png" width="400">

There is now one fewer event that needs my attention for the current day. If I navigate back to the home page, I am again informed that 1 event needs my attention for today.

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/12.png" width="400">

If I ignore this one event for the rest of today and returned to the main website tomorrow, I would still be informed that 1 event(s) needs my attention. However, this alert would now appear in the Tomorrow cell rather than in the Today cell. You can report context for your emotions either during the same day you reported the data or during the following day.

# Reporting Follow-up Data about your Emotion Events

We will periodically have brief follow-up questions for you regarding the events you reported on earlier in the study. You will be alerted to these follow-ups by a red number in the corner of the Follow-up Data cell. If you tap on the cell, you will see something like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/17.png" width="400">

In this case, we only have one prior event needing further data (the home screen indicated there were 2, but I completed one before taking the screenshot). Just like in the previous section, you can provide data about an event by tapping it and then supplying the requested data.

# Completing your Daily Time Diary

In addition to reporting emotions and contextual details about the events surrounding your emotions, we want to know about the activities you engage in throughout your day. You provide us this data by completing a time diary for each day of the study.

If you look back at this screenshot, you'll se that we have one time diary that needs our attention:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/12.png" width="400">

If you tap Yesterday to find out more about what's needed, you see this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/13.png" width="400">

Tapping the Update Your Time Diary button then leads you to this screen:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/14.png" width="400">

At the moment this screen is pretty barren. We will soon fill it with the activities we engaged in throughout the day, starting at midnight. By tapping Add Next Activity you'll begin this process, which will proceed similarly to when you reported contextual details for your emotions. Once you complete your first activity of the day your screen will look something like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/15.png" width="400">

You will be prompted to continue adding activities until you've covered 24 hours of time. At this point, the Add Next Activity button will disappar and a message at the top of the screen will indicate that you have completed the time diary. If you navigate back to the home screen, it would now look something like this:

<img src="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~rrinderk/TD_instructions/16.png" width="400">

Your progress is automatically saved every time you report an activity to your diary. You also do not need to complete your diary in one sitting. In fact, you can begin completing your diary for the current day (by tapping Today and then tapping Update Your Diary) and finish this diary the following day. You will be unable to complete your time diary for the current day because you are not allowed to report on activities that occur in the future.
